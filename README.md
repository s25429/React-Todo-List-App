## General Information
It is a very simple todo application using react. You can add tasks or double click on them to easily edit or delete them. The idea wasn't to create something incredibly pleasing or very user intuitive, but rather structuraly sound in the code - in a way that it makes sense and is easily maintainable. Beside some improvements that could be made to both functionality of certain specific actions or the cleanliness of the code, I believe the project is rather maintainable and compact for my level of skill in React.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript ES6+
- ReactJS 18.0
- react-icons 4.3.1
- starter project created using npx create-react-app

## Launching and Viewing
- You can easily view the app with github pages, either by clicking on the live demo link at the top of the readme file, or looking at the active environment on the project page
- You can always clone the project onto your machine with `git clone https://github.com/s25429/React-Todo-List-App.git`
- To view it locally, or to edit it, you have few possibilities: 
  - Run `npm start` to run it in your default browser - for testing
  - Run `npm build` to create an optimized product build - for publishing
  - Editting while having it run on your browser automatically applies changes

## Project Status
Project is plausibly completed for me. There would be some things to iron out, but I'm more inclined to apply my gained knowledge on a very similair project with a slight different application.
